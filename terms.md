Terms of Use for Glyph
Last updated: 07/31/25

Glyph is a local, self-hosted productivity assistant designed for private, non-commercial use. By using Glyph, you agree to the following terms.

1. Personal Use Only
Glyph is intended for use by the device owner or authorized user. It may not be sold, distributed, or offered as a service without explicit permission from the creator.

2. No Warranty
Glyph is provided "as is" with no guarantees. The author is not liable for any data loss, malfunction, or unintended behavior resulting from its use.

3. External Integrations
By connecting Glyph to third-party services (e.g. Notion), you agree to comply with their Terms of Use. You are responsible for any API usage or data synced with external services.

4. Modifications
You may modify Glyph for personal use. Contributions to the codebase are welcome via the original GitHub repository (if public), but this is not required.

5. Legal
These terms are informal and provided only to meet minimal compliance with API requirements (e.g. Notion OAuth). Glyph is not a publicly deployed product.
