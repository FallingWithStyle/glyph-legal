Privacy Policy for Glyph
Last updated: [Insert Date]

Glyph is a private, local AI assistant designed to run on your personal devices. This tool is intended for personal use only and is not distributed as a public service or application.

1. Data Collection
Glyph does not collect or store personal data externally. All operations, logs, and memories remain local to your machine unless explicitly configured otherwise.

If Notion integration is enabled:

Glyph uses the Notion API to read/write to your Notion workspace.

OAuth tokens are stored locally and never shared with third parties.

2. Data Usage
Any data entered into Glyph (via chat, voice, or planner inputs) is used solely to provide local assistance. Glyph does not transmit this data externally, except to services you have connected (e.g. Notion).

3. Third-Party Services
Glyph may optionally connect with the following services:

Notion (for memory and task syncing)

Ollama (for local LLM inference)

Tailscale (for private networking)

Use of these services is governed by their respective privacy policies.

4. Security
All API credentials are stored locally on your machine (e.g. in a .env file or secure vault). You are responsible for keeping your machine secure.

5. Contact
For questions about this policy, contact the owner of this installation directly. Glyph is not a public-facing product or service.
